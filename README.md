# PDF -> Tabling Questions iCal


Parliament publishes a table of when questions and when the deadlines for submitting questions are. It would be useful if an MPs office could subscribe to these via Outlook so not to miss important deadlines.

## Could we parse the PDF?

no, too hard, we lose all the positional data, this needs a human being to parse.

## Could we do Google Sheets -> Google Calendar?

Ok so what if we just have 1 human being enter the detais once and then generate a Google Calendar from it.

Maybe...
